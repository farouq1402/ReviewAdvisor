A Comparative Study of ICP-OES and AAS for Lead Determination in Urine Analysis
Abstract
This research study utilized experimental methods to compare the effectiveness of ICP-OES and AAS-GF techniques in measuring lead recovery in urine samples. The results showed that the average recovery percentages ranged from 91% to 108% (with an average of 99%) for the GF-AAS technique, while the ICP-OES technique yielded recovery percentages ranging from 90% to 99% (with an average of 98%). Both techniques demonstrated consistent outcomes, but the GF-AAS technology exhibited slightly higher recovery rates compared to ICP-OES. Statistical analysis using a T-test indicated no significant difference in the recovery percentages between GF-AAS and ICP-OES. Therefore, either technique can be used interchangeably based on the recovery results obtained in this study. 
Key words: AAS, ICO-OES, lead, urine analysis
Introduction
Lead is classified as a non-essential heavy metal that is known to be a prevalent environmental pollutant. It is often found alongside other non-essential heavy metals like cadmium, arsenic, and mercury, which have no known benefits for the physiology of humans, animals, and aquatic organisms. Increased levels of lead in the body are linked to neurotoxicity, and the current available medications for lead poisoning have numerous negative effects on human health. Research has focused on determining lead concentrations and developing more advanced and precise methods and devices for measurement. Lead is the oldest toxic heavy metal and can be found in various professional and environmental sources such as soil, rocks, water, and the aquatic environment. It can enter the body through inhalation, skin contact, or ingestion and subsequently distributes among red blood cells, soft tissues, and mineralized tissues. Individuals with high levels of heavy metals in their bodies are more vulnerable to diseases such as neurotoxicity, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, infertility, kidney damage, and cancer. Conversely, essential minerals like manganese, cobalt, iron, and zinc are present in small amounts in the body and play important roles as co-factors, enzymes, or mediators. However, excessive exposure to these minerals can also lead to toxicity in humans and other living organisms. Heavy metals, as inorganic compounds, assist in determining the variations in their concentration ratios in biological samples in relation to an individual's health. Elevated levels of heavy metals in biological samples indicate a pathological condition. Therefore, it is crucial to develop and employ robust and reliable analytical methods for accurately determining the levels of heavy metals in biological samples. One of the primary responsibilities of forensic toxicology is to identify the concentrations of heavy and toxic metals in biological materials obtained from individuals or collected during autopsies, as well as in samples of food, water, sewage, and specific substances. The improved technique for determining the concentration of heavy metals in multi-element analysis using ICP-OES and F-AAS allows for detection at extremely low levels. By employing both techniques, the advanced methods offer precise and accurate results. The recovery rates of the analyzed substances using these techniques exceed 90%. The analytical findings obtained from the prior concentration of samples using ICP-OES can be compared to those obtained using F-AAS (Barbara et al., 2007). Choosing suitable materials and analysis methods is a crucial aspect of correctly analyzing the elemental content, including both highly toxic and non-toxic elements that may occur naturally but become harmful in large quantities. Various approaches exist for determining different metals in food and biological samples (Taylor et al., 1999).
Various types of atomic absorption spectrometry are commonly employed in the toxicological analysis of non-organic compounds. These techniques differ based on the dissolution method used:
•	Flame Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS-F) (Vähäoja et al., 2005)
•	Electrothermal Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (ETAAS) (Caraballo et al., 2003)
•	Hydride Generation (HG) and Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (Ng & Moore, 1998)
•	Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (GF-AAS) (Oliveira & Oliveira, 2001)
•	X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) Spectroscopy (Schumacher et al., 2010)
•	Ion Chromatography (Emteborg & Bordin, 1998)
•	Dual Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) (Goullé et al., 2005)
•	Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES) (Mochizuki et al., 2002)
The latter two techniques, ICP-MS and ICP-OES, allow for relatively fast determination of multiple elements while ensuring analytical precision, accuracy, detection limits, and quantitative estimation. They are increasingly utilized in studying elements like selenium (Mochizuki et al., 2002), lead (Cho & Myung, 2011), and arsenic (Grotti et al., 2006).

EXPERIMENTAL
Instrumentation
In this study, an Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES) instrument from Agilent Technologies, USA (Model 5110 VDV) was used. The instrument consisted of an octopole ion guide and a cell that could be pressurized with a reaction gas (H₂ and He). The optimization of the chamber involved investigating the impact of the gas used on the signal of the studied elements. Microwave digestion was performed using the ETHOS ONE High-Performance Microwave Digestion System from Milestone. 
Samples
Thirty urine samples were collected from healthy volunteers of both genders and different age groups. Special plastic containers with a 100 ml capacity were used for sample collection. Standard urine sample collection methods were followed to ensure minimal heavy metal contamination. Each urine sample was treated with 0.5 ml of 69% nitric acid (HNO₃) and stored in a freezer at -20°C until analysis. 
Standard Solutions, Reagents, and Calibration
Microwave radiation in high-pressure digestion vessels was utilized for sample digestion, enabling rapid digestion of samples and making it suitable for routine analysis of trace elements. The calibration standard solution for lead (Pb) was a single element solution with a concentration of 1 mg/ml, provided by Agilent Technologies, USA. The calibration standard solution was prepared at a concentration of 10 ppm in 5% nitric acid (HNO₃).
Unspiked samples (Blank) and spiked samples were prepared by withdrawing a volume of 5 mL from each urine sample and adding specific amounts of standard solution. Nitric acid and hydrogen peroxide were added to all samples. The sealed plastic vessels containing the samples were subjected to microwave digestion according to the specified method. 
Statistical Analyses:
Descriptive statistics including mean and standard deviations were analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software version 20.0. ANOVA-test (p<0.05) was used for the analysis of quantitative data. Microsoft Excel and Origin software were also employed to assess the significance of differences between variables in blood samples. The concentration values obtained were expressed as mean ± standard deviation. 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
This study aims to analyze and quantify the presence of lead in urine samples. The primary objective is to determine the most effective technique for estimating lead levels in urine, comparing atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS) and inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) to identify the method that yields the highest recovery rate. In this study, a calibration using five standard points under optimal conditions was employed for lead analysis. The obtained results for all analyzed elements were documented. The calibration coefficient for lead was established to assess the quality of analysis using both ICP-OES and AAS technologies, specifically for analyzing and quantifying the levels of these elements in urine samples.
Method Validation
In the fields of criminal and clinical toxicology, analytical methods are employed to identify and measure the levels of drugs, toxins, metabolites, and heavy metals in biological fluids or tissues. To ensure the accuracy and reliability of these quantitative biochemical procedures, it is generally recommended to conduct certain validation assays. These assays include assessing linearity, determining the limit of quantitation (LOQ), and may also involve measuring the limit of detection (LOD) and recovery rates. These validation assays are important for establishing the reliability and sensitivity of the analytical methods used in the field of toxicology (Shah et al., 2000).
Calibration curves (linearity)
The calibration curve is a graphical representation that illustrates the relationship between the concentration of the substance being analyzed in a sample and the corresponding response observed in bioanalytical analysis methods. This response is often expressed as the intensity ratio of the substance to a reference concentration. Selecting the appropriate calibration curve is crucial for accurate quantitative determination of the substance. To establish a reliable calibration curve, an adequate number of standard solutions must be measured, allowing for the derivation of a mathematical equation that accurately describes the relationship between concentration and intensity (Kruve et al., 2015).
In bioanalytical analysis methods, standard solutions are prepared by mixing the substance to be analyzed with a control biological sample. It is important that these solutions cover the entire calibration range and have equal spacing throughout (Kruve et al., 2015). A correlation coefficient (r2) greater than 0.99 is generally considered an appropriate acceptance criterion for calibration curve outputs (Batanero et al., 1996). The calibration curves for lead in urine samples in this study were plotted. Figures (1) and (2) depict the calibration curves for urine using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer and Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry, respectively. The correlation coefficients and regression equations for both instruments are presented in Table (3).

Sensitivity and accuracy of machine:
The sensitivity of the device used to estimate the target element in urine samples is determined by two important parameters: the limit of detection (LOD) and the limit of quantitation (LOQ). The LOD represents the lowest concentration at which the device can reliably detect the presence of the element, while the LOQ represents the lowest concentration that can be accurately quantified (Shah et al., 2000).
To ensure the accuracy and validity of the results, it is necessary to determine the extent of detection and assessment of impurities using appropriate methods. Table 4 presents the calculated threshold values, the recovery ratio of the standard lead element, and the validity of the results and method. These parameters provide valuable information about the sensitivity and reliability of the analytical method employed in the study.

Recovery:
The percentage recovery of the substance being estimated can be calculated to assess its response after extraction, relative to a standard solution of the substance at the same concentration, which represents 100% (Lindner, 1998). Typically, a range of ±10% is considered acceptable for controls, while a recovery value within the range of 90% to 110% is generally accepted (Olmedo et al., 2010).

ANOVA T-test:
Table (7) presents the results obtained for the lead component, including the average and normative deviations from three repeated measurements. The concentrations obtained from both Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (ASS) and Inductively Coupled Plasma-EE (ICP-OES) are compared using a T-Test with a significance level of p = 0.05.
The T-Test analysis for the lead component in Table (7) reveals that the p-value for both ASS and ICP-OES is 0.366. Since the p-value is greater than the significance level of 0.05, it indicates that there is no significant difference in the recovery rates between ASS and ICP-OES technologies for the lead element. This suggests that either of these techniques can be used to achieve accurate results, which is consistent with the findings obtained from the accuracy analysis.

Conclusion
In this study, the experimental scientific method was utilized to compare the performance of two technologies, Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic Emission Spectrometry (ICP-AES) and Graphite Furnace-Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (GF-AAS), for estimating the recovery of lead in urine samples. The results indicated that using GF-AAS technology, the average recovery rate for urine samples ranged from 91% to 108%, with an average of 99% for the lead component. On the other hand, using ICP-OES technology, the average recovery rate ranged from 90% to 99%, with an average of 98% for the lead component. The lead concentrations detected were 2.77 micrograms/L using ICP-OES and 0.92 micrograms/L using GF-AAS. For the average lead concentration, ICP-OES yielded 1.60 micrograms/L, while GF-AAS resulted in 2.65 micrograms/L.
Based on these results, it can be concluded that both GF-AAS and ICP-OES technologies can be used to estimate lead concentrations in urine samples. The recovery rates for both techniques were comparable, with GF-AAS showing slightly higher recovery rates. The T-Test analysis for the lead component indicated that there was no significant difference in recovery rates between GF-AAS and ICP-AES technologies, with a p-value of 0.366 (p < 0.05). This suggests that either technology can be used as an alternative to the other, which aligns with the recovery results.
